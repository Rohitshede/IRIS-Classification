# IRIS Classification
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at classifying IRIS flower species using various classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known IRIS dataset, which is often used as a benchmark in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of IRIS flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
